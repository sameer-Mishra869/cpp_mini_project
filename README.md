📌 Project Description
The Student Management System is a simple C++ console-based mini project.
It allows the user to manage student records easily using basic programming concepts like:
Arrays
Functions
Loops
Conditional statements
File handling (if used)
This project helps in understanding core concepts of C++ programming.

🎯 Features
The system provides the following functionalities:
➕ Add Student
📋 Display All Students
🔍 Search Student by Roll Number
✏️ Update Student Details
❌ Delete Student Record
🚪 Exit Program
🛠 Technologies Used
Language: C++
Platform: Console Application
Compiler: g++ / Turbo C++ / VS Code (MinGW)

🧠 Concepts Used
Functions
Arrays
Loops (for loop)
if-else conditions
Basic input/output (cin, cout)
Data validation

▶️ How to Run the Project
Step 1: Compile the program
g++ mini_basic.cpp -o student
Step 2: Run the program
./student

📊 Sample Functional Explanation
🔹 displayAll()
Checks if there are students.
Uses loop to print all student details.
Displays total number of students.
🔹 searchStudent()
Takes roll number input.
Compares with stored roll numbers.
Displays student data if found.
Shows "Student not found" if no match.
📈 Learning Outcome
After completing this project, I understood:
How to manage data using arrays
How functions improve code structure
How searching works using loops
How to build menu-driven programs
Basic project structure for GitHub

🔮 Future Improvements
Add file handling permanently
Use structures instead of separate arrays
Add login system
Convert to GUI application
Connect with database
📷 Project Preview (Console Based)
This is a simple text-based menu system that runs inside terminal.

⭐ Conclusion
This mini project helped me strengthen my basics of C++ programming and understand how real-world management systems work in a simple way.
